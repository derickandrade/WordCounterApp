The shuttle slid through the cloth: green, brown, green, brown,
picking up the other shuttle every tenth row, changing the color. She
had taught Maline to dye this green color, which she had learned in
Avalon ... green of the new leaves coming into the spring, brown of
the earth and of the fallen leaves where the boar rooted in the forest
for acorns... shuttle sliding through the cloth, the comb to tighten each
row of threads, her hands moving automatically, in and out and
across, slide down the bar, pick up the shuttle from the other side ...
would that Avalloch's horse would slip and fall and he would break
his neck and save me from what I must do ...
